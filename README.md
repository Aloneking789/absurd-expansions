## Guidelines for Absurd Expansions:

- Be creative: Think outside the box and come up with expansions that are delightfully absurd.
- Keep it light-hearted: We're here to have fun, so avoid anything offensive or inappropriate.
- Stick to programming-related terms: While the expansions may be absurd, they should still relate to programming, technology, or software development.

## Example Absurd Expansions:

- **PIP:** Penguins In Pajamas
- **NPM:** Neil Patrick's Mansion
- **API:** Antelopes Performing Incantations
